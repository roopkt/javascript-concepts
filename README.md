# Welcome to Javascript Concepts 

## Introduction
In this little project, I will try to explain few javascript concepts that I believe important and one javascript developer should know them. I have also added one example for each concept so that you can understand better. Please let me know if you find any issues or questions. 

All the questions which I covered those are the frequently asked questions for javascript interview.

## How to start
Please open the src/index.html file in any browser and then you can click on each concepts and you will see the example and definition for that concept.
